/*An insurance company follows the following rules to calculate premium.
a. If a personâ€™s health is excellent and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and
lives in a city and is a male then the premium is Rs. 4 per thousand.
b. If a person satisfies all the above conditions except that the gender is female then the
premium is Rs. 3 per thousand.
c. If a personâ€™s health is poor and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives in
a village and is a male then the premium is Rs. 6 per thousand.
d. In all other cases the person is not insured.
Write a PL/SQL block to input personâ€™s health, age, city and gender. From the rules given
above, display the message whether the person is insured or not. If insured, display
